This is a modification of puddinpop's miner.
This modification will allow users to compile this miner with CUDA or Opencl support and install it in easly manner.

*********************
* RPC MINER CLIENT 
*********************
(ARGUMENTS MAY BE COMBINED WITH CUDA/OPENCL ARGUMENTS)
RPC miner client arguments

-url=http://example.com:8332
	The URL of the RPC server.
	
-user=username
	The username used to connect to the RPC server.
	
-password=password
	The password used to connect to the RPC server.
	
-threads=x
	Start this number of miner threads.  The default value is the number of cores
	on your processor if using a CPU miner, or 1 if using a GPU miner.
	
-workrefreshms=xxxx
	Work will be refreshed from the server this often.  Each thread that is 
	started needs its own work.  The default value is 4000ms.  If you have a
	fast miner, or are using lots of threads, you might want to reduce this.

-statsurl=http://example.com/stats/json
	The URL of a server that will respond with a json object of the server stats.
	Currently, only slush's server stats are available.  The stats will be
	printed by the client every minute.  Not specifying a url will result in no
	stats being displayed.


*********************
* CUDA MINER
*********************
CUDA miner arguments

-gpu=X
	Turns on GPU processing on specific GPU device.  Indexes start at 0.  If you 
	just use -gpu without =X it will pick the first device found.

-aggression=X
	Specifies how many hashes (2^(X-1)) per kernel thread will be calculated.  
	The default is 6.  It starts at 1 and goes to 32, with each successive
	number meaning double the number of hashes.  Sane values are 1 to 12 or
	maybe 14 if you have some super card.

-gpugrid=X
	Specifies what the grid size of the kernel should be.  Useful for fine tuning 
	hash rate.

-gputhreads=X
	Specifies how many threads per kernel invocation should run.  Useful for fine 
	tuning hash rate.

-port=X
	Specifies the port that bitcoin will listen on.  (When run in GUI or daemon)

-rpcport=X
	Specifies the port that the rpc server will listen on.  (When run in GUI or daemon)



*********************
* OPENCL MINER
*********************
Make sure bitcoinmineropencl.cl is in the bitcoin working directory for the server and 
rpc miner, and remotebitcoinmineropencl.cl for the remote miner.

OpenCL miner arguments

-platform=X
	Use specific OpenCL platform at index X.  Indexes start at 0.  Default is 0.
	
-gpu=X
	Turns on GPU processing on specific GPU device on specified platform.
	Indexes start at 0.  If you just use -gpu without =X it will pick the first 
	device found.

-aggression=X
	Specifies how many hashes (2^(X-1)) per kernel thread will be calculated.  
	The default is 6.  It starts at 1 and goes to 32, with each successive
	number meaning double the number of hashes.  Sane values are 1 to 12 or
	maybe 14 if you have some super card.

-gpugrid=X
	Specifies what the grid size of the kernel should be.  Useful for fine tuning 
	hash rate.

-gputhreads=X
	Specifies how many threads per kernel invocation should run.  Useful for fine 
	tuning hash rate.

-port=X
	Specifies the port that bitcoin will listen on.  (When run in GUI or daemon)

-rpcport=X
	Specifies the port that the rpc server will listen on.  (When run in GUI or daemon)
