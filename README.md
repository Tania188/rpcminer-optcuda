rpcminer-optcuda
================

Optimalized CUDA version of the rpcminer:
(see: https://github.com/Ang3lus/rpcminer-mod and https://github.com/psychocoder-germany/rpcminer-mod

15-30% better mining performance compared to the original version.

Optimalized for Fermi (GTX-4xx-5xx) and Kepler (GTX-6xx) Nvidia cards.

Legacy or newer card support will come later

Anyone 

The planned stages and goals:

1. OpenSource (see the original version for compilation help)
2. Add compile and run scripts and a probably usefull user documentation.
3. Builded binaries for multiple platorms (Linux, Windows)
4. Optimalize to older cards
5. Optimalize to newer cards
6. Suggest a new goal in forum ( https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=215958 )
