rpcminer-optcuda
================

Optimalized CUDA version of the rpcminer:
(see: https://github.com/Ang3lus/rpcminer-mod and https://github.com/psychocoder-germany/rpcminer-mod)

15-30% better mining performance compared to the original version (puddinpop's miner).

Optimalized for Fermi (GTX-4xx-5xx) and Kepler (GTX-6xx) Nvidia cards.

Legacy or newer card support will come later

USE Cuda toolkit 4.2 and not the 5.0! It is very important!

Please read the following files: README, README.md, HOW-TO. Thanks

The planned stages and goals:

1. OpenSource (see the original version for compilation help)
2. Add compile and run scripts and a probably usefull user documentation.
3. Builded binaries for multiple platorms (Linux, Windows)
4. Optimalize to older cards
5. Optimalize to newer cards
6. Suggest a new goal in forum ( https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=215958 )
