rpcminer-optcuda
================

Optimalized CUDA version of the original rpcminer

15-30% better mining performance compared to the original version.

Optimalized for Fermi (GTX-4xx-5xx) and Kepler (GTX-6xx) Nvidia cards.

Legacy or newer card support will come later

This is a BTC donation based project, the planned stages and goals:

1. (5 BTC) Linux Private Beta, the optimalized binary will be available for 20 beta tester for more information see project wiki page (later)
2. (10 BTC) Windows Private Beta, the optimalized binary will be available for 20 beta tester for more information see project wiki page (later)
3. (20 BTC) OpenSource, I will upload the source, the compile and run scripts and a probably usefull user documentation. All issues during the beta stage will be fixed.
4. Suggest a new goal in forum (later)
